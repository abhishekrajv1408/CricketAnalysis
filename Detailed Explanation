As a data analyst and a cricket enthusiast, I wanted to go beyond the traditional stats and select the Best XI of the 2023 World Cup using a data-driven approach.

🔹 How I Did It?
✅ Data Scraping – Collected match-wise performance data
✅ Data Cleaning – Processed and refined the dataset
✅ Data Visualization (Power BI) – Created insightful dashboards
✅ Role-Specific Criteria – Evaluated players based on their positions:

● Openers: Consistency & Strike Rate

● Middle Order: Stability & Impact in Chases

● Finishers: Strike Rate in Death Overs

● All-rounders: Balance of Bat & Ball Performance

● Bowlers: Wickets, Economy & Impact in Key Moments

The final XI is based on performance trends, impact metrics, and match-winning contributions rather than just total runs or wickets!

Check out my analysis and let me know – Do you agree with my Best XI? Who would make your list? 👇
